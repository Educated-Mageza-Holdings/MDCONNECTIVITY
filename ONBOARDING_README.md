## API Integration Points

const response = await fetch('/api/register', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(registrationData)
});
```

### Login (`handleLogin` in onboarding-script.js):
```javascript
// Replace demo code with:
const response = await fetch('/api/login', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ email, password })
});
```

### Quote Generation:
